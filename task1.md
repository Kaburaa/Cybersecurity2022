A VirtualBox through research; is an open-source software used for virtualization of the computer architecture. 
It can be hosted on any operating system; windows and Linux.


Downloaded the oracle virtual box.

Once the virtual box was up and running, I started the process of downloading the ISO files from google chrome.
The Windows ISO file and the Linux – Ubuntu ISO file and kept them in a folder.

On the virtual box on the Tools bar I created a new Virtual machine which prompted the window below;
I named the virtual Machine and designated the version of operating system that I specifically wanted to put; in this case I named it Ubuntu 64 bit which is a Linux OS.

After adding the operating system ,allocated the space of 1024GB as memory size.

Allocated the amount of size  as 32 GB and determined the file location in my pc.
Installed the Ubuntu operating system and the the Windows operating system .
CHALLENGES FACED
•	The operating systems took a long time to set up and complete installation.
•	Allocation of too much space to a virtual machine.

SOLUTIONS
•	Allocated enough space for both virtual machines.
